// Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each 
// time a petal was torn:
// 
// "I love you"
// "a little"
// "a lot"
// "passionately"
// "madly"
// "not at all"
// 
// If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on.
// 
// When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.
// 
// Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals 
// is always greater than 0.
