// The purpose of this kata is to work out just how many bottles of duty free whiskey you would have to buy such that the savings over the normal high 
// street price would effectively cover the cost of your holiday.
// 
// You will be given the high street price (normPrice, in £ (Pounds)), the duty free discount (discount, in percent) and the cost of the holiday (in £).
// 
// For example, if a bottle costs £10 normally and the duty free discount is 10%, you would save £1 per bottle. If your holiday will cost £500, you would 
// have to purchase 500 bottles to save £500, so the answer you return should be 500.
// 
// Another example: if a bottle costs £12 normally and the duty free discount is 50%, you would save £6 per bottle. If your holiday will cost £1000, you 
// would have to purchase 166.66 bottles to save £1000, so your answer should be 166 bottles.
// 
// All inputs will be integers. Please return an integer. Round down.
