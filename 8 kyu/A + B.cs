// Vasya Pupkin just started learning Java and C#. At first, he decided to write simple program that was supposed to sum up two small numbers 
// (numbers and their sum fit in a byte), but it didn't work. Vasya was too sad to find out what is wrong. Help him to correct the mistake.

public class FirstClass 
{
    public static byte sum (byte a, byte b)
    {
        return (byte)(a + b);
    }
